# -Project-Assistance-Analyzing-Customer-Churn
Scenario: You work for a telecommunications company called Teleconfia.
They are trying to establish themselves in the USA. They are running a trial in Florida.
New customers were able to use cellphones on the Teleconfia network at very low rates for one year.
Not all customers stayed with Teleconfia for one year, many of them left.
The company wants to tackle the problem of customer churn with two marketing campaigns.
The first marketing campaign is aimed at cities and will involve large posters.
One city counts as a small town or a district in a larger city.
The four cities with the highest rate of customer churn will be selected for the marketing campaign.
The second marketing campaign will focus on individual customers. 
Customers who are likely to leave Teleconfia should receive a phone call to offer them a special deal.
You have been asked which data is necessary to make these decisions
and what the thresholds should be for the company to contact the customer.
To avoid things becoming too complicated, you should identify a categorical data series,
an integer data series and a floating point data series.
For the floating point data series,
you should calculate the threshold by using logistic regression:
from what point is a customer more likely to leave than stay?
You should produce visualizations to back up your decisions.
